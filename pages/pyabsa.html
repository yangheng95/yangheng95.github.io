                <h2 class="title">Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    PyABSA is a modular framework designed for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). ABSA focuses on
                    identifying the sentiment expressed towards specific aspects of an entity in texts, making it
                    valuable for tasks like opinion mining, product reviews, and customer feedback analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PyABSA aims to simplify ABSA tasks by providing pre-trained models, datasets, and a flexible
                    interface for both researchers and developers. It integrates widely-used machine learning libraries
                    and tools, such as Hugging Face and TensorFlow, allowing users to apply and fine-tune
                    state-of-the-art ABSA models with ease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PyABSA addresses the challenges of deploying, benchmarking, and developing new ABSA models by
                    offering standardized benchmarking suites, open-source models, and comprehensive tutorials. PyABSA
                    is designed to bridge the gap between research and real-world applications of sentiment analysis.
